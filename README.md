## Dense vs Sparse Grids

This library provides two approaches for working with 2D grids:

### **Dense Arrays (`DenseGrid`)**
A **dense grid** is a fully allocated 2D NumPy array where every cell exists in memory, even if most cells are zero or empty.

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Stores complete grid in memory (all rows √ó columns cells)
- ‚úÖ Fast random access to any cell
- ‚úÖ Supports visualization and full grid operations
- ‚ùå Uses O(rows √ó cols) memory regardless of how many cells are active
- ‚ùå Memory-intensive for large, mostly-empty grids

**Use when:**
- You need to visualize or modify the full grid
- You'll access cells randomly throughout the grid
- The grid is relatively small or mostly filled
- You need the actual grid values for further processing

**Example:**
```python
from grid_counting import DenseGrid

# Allocates full 100√ó100 = 10,000 cells in memory
denseGrid = DenseGrid(100, 100)
denseGrid.set_locations_to_value([(10, 10), (20, 20)], value=2)
count = denseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()  # Counts from full grid array
```

### **Sparse Arrays (`SparseGrid`)**
A **sparse grid** stores only the locations and values of active cells without allocating the full grid.

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Memory efficient: Only stores active cell locations
- ‚úÖ 3-6x faster for counting operations (no grid allocation)
- ‚úÖ Optimal for large grids with few active cells
- ‚ùå Cannot access arbitrary cells directly (no full grid)
- ‚ùå Cannot visualize full grid (only has location data)

**Use when:**
- You only need counts, not the full grid
- Grid is large but most cells are inactive/zero
- Memory is constrained
- Performance is critical for counting operations

**Example:**
```python
from grid_counting import SparseGrid

# No grid allocation - only stores locations [(10,10), (20,20)]
sparseGrid = SparseGrid(100, 100)
sparseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value([(10, 10), (20, 20)], L=3, value=2)
count = sparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
```

### **Quick Decision Guide**

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Full grid for visualization | `DenseGrid` |
| Full grid for further processing | `DenseGrid` |
| Random cell access | `DenseGrid` |
| Just counting cells | `SparseGrid` |
| Large mostly-empty grids | `SparseGrid` |
| Maximum performance for counting | `SparseGrid` |

## Installation

### Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended)

# Create virtual environment, activate, and install dependencies
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries

## Examples

```python
import numpy as np
from grid_counting import DenseGrid, SparseGrid

# Create a dense grid and count positive values
my_2d_array = np.array([
    [1, 2, 0],   # row 0
    [0, 5, -3],  # row 1
    [4, 0, 1]    # row 2
])
denseGrid = DenseGrid(my_2d_array)
count = denseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()  # Returns 5

# Set specific locations to 2
denseGrid = DenseGrid(5, 5)
denseGrid.set_locations_to_value([(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)], value=2)

# Count Manhattan neighborhoods (OPTIMAL - no grid creation)
sparseGrid = SparseGrid(100, 100)
sparseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value([(10, 10), (20, 20), (30, 30)], L=3, value=2)
count = sparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
# Returns count of positive-valued cells within L=3 from all locations
```

## Classes

### `DenseGrid(height, width, initial_value=0)`
A dense 2D grid represented as a numpy array.

**Parameters:**
- `height`: Number of rows
- `width`: Number of columns
- `initial_value`: Value to fill grid with (default=0)

**Methods:**
- `set_locations_to_value(locations, value=2)`: Set specified locations to a value
- `set_neighborhoods_to_value(locations, L=3, value=2)`: Set neighborhoods around locations using BFS
- `count_positive_valued_cells()`: Count positive-valued cells using hardware acceleration

**Example:**
```python
import numpy as np
from grid_counting import DenseGrid

# Create new grid
denseGrid = DenseGrid(5, 5)

# Set locations to a value
denseGrid.set_locations_to_value([(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4)], value=2)

# Set neighborhoods around locations
denseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value([(1, 1), (3, 3)], L=2, value=2)

# Count positive values
count = denseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
```

### `SparseGrid(height, width)`
A sparse grid that stores only seed locations and Manhattan distance, avoiding full grid allocation.

**Parameters:**
- `height`: Number of rows (must be > 0)
- `width`: Number of columns (must be > 0)

**Methods:**
- `set_locations_to_value(locations, value=2)`: Set specified locations to a single value (applies same value to all locations)
- `set_neighborhoods_to_value(locations, L, value=2)`: Set neighborhoods around locations using BFS (applies same value to all unset cells)
- `count_positive_valued_cells()`: Count positive-valued cells without creating grid

#### Definition: locations
- A list or iterable of zero-based `(row, col)` integer tuples, e.g. `[(r, c), ...]`.
- Rows in `[0, height-1]`, columns in `[0, width-1]`; out-of-bounds entries are ignored.
- Duplicates are allowed and have no additional effect.
- Single location may be provided as a 2-tuple `(row, col)`; it is treated as one item.

**Benefits:**
- Fastest approach (3-6x faster than creating grid)
- Memory efficient (no grid allocation)
- Handles overlapping neighborhoods correctly
- Does not count neighborhood cells that lie outside of array boundary

**Example:**
```python
from grid_counting import SparseGrid

# Create sparse grid
sparseGrid = SparseGrid(100, 100)

# Set neighborhoods around locations
sparseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value([(10, 10), (50, 50), (90, 90)], L=5, value=2)

# Count positive-valued cells (no grid creation!)
count = sparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
```

### `detect_available_accelerators()`
Detects which hardware accelerators are available.

**Returns:**
- Dictionary with acceleration capabilities

## Performance

The function uses hardware acceleration in this priority order:

1. **JAX (GPU/TPU)** - Fastest for large arrays on compatible hardware
2. **PyTorch (GPU)** - Excellent CUDA/MPS support
3. **NumPy (CPU)** - Highly optimized C-based implementation

All methods are significantly faster than naive Python loops.

### Performance Comparison

For neighborhood counting operations:

- **Direct counting** (`SparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()`): 3-6x faster than creating a grid
- **BFS approach** (`DenseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value()`): Optimal for sparse seeds, ~0.06ms for 2 seeds
- **Vectorized approach**: Best for dense seeds or large grids

### Performance Testing

The test suite includes performance benchmarks that automatically run:

1. **Hardware Detection** - Verifies CPU/GPU/TPU accelerator detection
2. **Small Array Performance** - Benchmarks counting operations on small arrays
3. **Manhattan Performance** - Compares direct counting vs grid creation (3-6x speedup)

Run `python grid_counting_tests.py` to see all functionality and performance tests.

## Optimal Approaches for Setting Manhattan Neighborhood Values

### **What is BFS? (Breadth-First Search)**

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level. For Manhattan neighborhoods:

1. **Starts at each seed location** - Beginning points for filling
2. **Expands outward level by level** - Processes all cells at distance 1, then 2, then 3, etc.
3. **Uses a queue (FIFO)** - First cells found are processed first
4. **Marks visited cells** - Prevents revisiting cells or double-counting overlaps
5. **Stops at max distance** - Only fills up to the specified Manhattan distance L

**Manhattan Distance Formula:** `|row‚ÇÅ - row‚ÇÇ| + |col‚ÇÅ - col‚ÇÇ|`

For a seed at (5, 5) with L=3, BFS would fill a diamond-shaped pattern of all cells within 3 steps in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

### **Current Implementation (BFS - Recommended)**

The `DenseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value()` method uses Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is **optimal for most cases**.

**Why BFS is optimal:**
1. ‚úÖ **Handles overlaps correctly** - Visited cells are never revisited
2. ‚úÖ **Memory efficient** - Only stores frontier, not all distances
3. ‚úÖ **Fastest for sparse seeds** - O(k * L¬≤) where k = number of seeds
4. ‚úÖ **Early termination** - Stops at max_distance

**Performance results:**
- Sparse seeds (2 seeds): ~0.06ms
- Medium seeds (5 seeds): ~0.39ms  
- Dense seeds (10 seeds): ~0.47ms

### **Alternative Approaches**

**1. Vectorized Distance Computation**
```python
# For each seed, compute Manhattan distance to ALL cells
for seed_row, seed_col in seeds:
    manhattan_dist = np.abs(row_coords - seed_row) + np.abs(col_coords - seed_col)
    result[manhattan_dist <= max_distance] = target_value
```

**Best for:** Dense seeds, large grids, when you need all distance values  
**Time:** O(k * n * m)  
**Space:** O(k * n * m)

**2. Convolution-Based**
```python
from scipy import signal
# Create mask and apply convolution
mask = create_distance_mask(L)
convolved = signal.convolve2d(seed_mask, mask, mode='same')
```

**Best for:** Repeated operations on same grid structure  
**Time:** O(n * m * L¬≤)  
**Notes:** Requires scipy, best when processing many grids

**3. Morphological Dilation**
```python
from scipy.ndimage import binary_dilation
# Dilate seeds L times
dilated = binary_dilation(seed_mask, iterations=L)
```

**Best for:** Very large grids, morphological operations  
**Notes:** Uses scipy, can be faster for L=1

### **Performance Comparison Results**

| Approach | Array Size | 2 Seeds (L=3) | 5 Seeds (L=5) | 10 Seeds (L=4) |
|:---------|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| **BFS (Current)** | 100√ó100 | 0.06ms | 0.39ms | 0.47ms |
| **Vectorized** | 100√ó100 | 0.06ms | 0.19ms | 1.12ms |
| **Convolution** | 100√ó100 | 0.66ms | 5.26ms | 34.67ms |
| **Morphological** | 100√ó100 | 0.08ms | 0.42ms | 0.52ms |

### **Recommendations**

**Use BFS (Current) when:**
- ‚úÖ Sparse or medium density seeds
- ‚úÖ Overlapping neighborhoods need correct handling
- ‚úÖ Memory efficiency matters
- ‚úÖ Small to medium L values (‚â§ 10)

**Use Vectorized when:**
- ‚úÖ Many seeds (>20)
- ‚úÖ You need distance matrices anyway
- ‚úÖ Large grids (1000√ó1000+)
- ‚úÖ Already have coordinate arrays

**Use Morphological when:**
- ‚úÖ Very large grids
- ‚úÖ L = 1 (4-neighborhood)
- ‚úÖ Already using scipy.ndimage
- ‚úÖ Need other morphological operations

### **Why BFS is Optimal**

The current implementation in `DenseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value()` uses BFS because:

1. **Automatic overlap handling** - Visited array prevents double-counting
2. **Early termination** - Only processes cells within distance L
3. **Memory efficient** - Queue size bounded by perimeter of neighborhood
4. **Simple logic** - Easy to understand and maintain
5. **Proven performance** - Fast for typical use cases

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(k * L¬≤) per seed, where L¬≤ is the area of the diamond
- Space: O(n * m) for visited array
- Actually visits only O(k * L¬≤) cells, not O(n * m)

**Example for L=3:**
- One seed creates ~13 cells (1 + 4 + 8 diamond)
- BFS visits exactly these 13 cells
- Vectorized computes distance for all n√óm cells
- BFS is faster when n√óm >> L¬≤

## Example Usage

### Counting Positive Values

```python
import numpy as np
from grid_counting import DenseGrid

# Create a large random array
large_array = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)

# Count positive elements
denseGrid = DenseGrid(large_array)
count = denseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
print(f"Positive count: {count}")
```

### Setting Locations

```python
from grid_counting import DenseGrid

# Create a grid with specific locations set to 2
locations = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
denseGrid = DenseGrid(5, 5)
denseGrid.set_locations_to_value(locations, value=2)
print(denseGrid.grid)
# Output:
# [[2 0 0 0 0]
#  [0 2 0 0 0]
#  [0 0 2 0 0]
#  [0 0 0 0 0]
#  [0 0 0 0 0]]
```

### Manhattan Neighborhoods

```python
from grid_counting import SparseGrid, DenseGrid

# Count without creating grid (OPTIMAL)
sparseGrid = SparseGrid(100, 100)
sparseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value([(10, 10), (20, 20)], L=3, value=2)
count = sparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
print(f"Cells in neighborhoods: {count}")

# For visualization with grid
denseGrid = DenseGrid(100, 100)
locations = [(10, 10), (20, 20)]
denseGrid.set_neighborhoods_to_value(locations, L=3, value=2)
```

### Complete Workflow

```python
from grid_counting import DenseGrid, SparseGrid

# Option 1: Count with grid creation
active_locations = [(0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (2, 2)]
denseGrid = DenseGrid(5, 5)
denseGrid.set_locations_to_value(active_locations, value=2)
count = denseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
print(f"Active cells: {count}")

# Option 2: Count without grid (FASTER!)
sparseGrid = SparseGrid(5, 5)
sparseGrid.set_locations_to_value(active_locations, value=2)
count = sparseGrid.count_positive_valued_cells()
print(f"Active cells: {count}")
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Install GPU libraries**: For arrays larger than 1000√ó1000, GPU acceleration provides significant speedup
2. **Use NumPy arrays**: Converting Python lists to NumPy arrays adds overhead
3. **Use `SparseGrid`**: For counting only, don't create grids (3-6x faster)
4. **Batch operations**: For multiple arrays, consider batching operations

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy 1.20+ (required)
- PyTorch 2.0+ (optional, for GPU support)
- JAX 0.4+ (optional, for GPU/TPU support)
